        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:xx-large;"><b>Ken Wilber's</b></span> 
            Integral framework has been the subject of his 
            best-selling, globally-translated books since the 1980s.
            His grand "Theory of Everything" synthesizes the history of human thought, culture,
            and values into a grand vision of a kosmos devoted to infinitely unfolding evolution 
            and an ever-escalating awakening of spirit as consciousness.

        <!-- <h3><em>Who</em> is this guy?</h3> -->
        <!-- <p>In spite of an intensely positive niche 
            response, Wilber's work is largely unknown, and often dismissed as overly mystical, 
            cerebral, insensitive, or non-academic. -->
        <!-- </p> -->
        <!-- <h3>On the Other Hand</h3> -->
        <!-- <p>
            In topics of meditation, human potential, 
            and consciousness evolution, Wilber is celebrated precisely <em>for</em> bringing 
            intellectual skepticism, postmodern sensitivity, and analytical grounding to this
            perennial field of human endeavor.

        <!-- <h3>Integral Theory exposes how people comprehend the nature of reality 
            and the experience of being with the AQAL Map: a system of visual diagrams
            which model the nature of reality and the developmental flows of human
            consciousness, derived from synthesizing academic, literary, and esoteric sources.
        </h3> -->
        <!-- <h3>Everybody is Right</h3>
        <p> 
            Starting from the premise that every perspective is correct 
            at least through it's own internal mental processes governing perception, 
            Wilber set out to map, define, organize,
            and categorize these "lenses" through which we perceive. -->
            <!-- One thing which becomes clear is that  -->
        <!-- </p> -->
        <!-- <h3>Spirituality Included</h3>
        <p>
            Transcendental spiritual development is decidedly central to the nature of perceptual lenses.
            The social tendency is to subjugate this observation to
            magical fantasy and wish fulfillment, or to believe in it as those. 
            Integral examines world religion with a unique 
            methodology to help sort out eternal wisdom from outdated garbage, resulting in spirituality 
            that anyone, especially atheists, can communicate about and practice. 
        </p> -->
        <!-- <p>
            More importantly, though, we live in denial of Levels.

        <!-- <h3>Levels of how we Think, Feel, and Do üëâüèø</h3> -->
        <!-- <p> -->
            <!-- Instead of defining the nature of a supposed given reality,  -->
            <!-- Wilber deconstructs our various lenses, or modes of perceiving reality,  
            revealing the limitations and biases inherent to each in an 
            elegant developmental stage system. <b>These Levels are core patterns which 
            arise in self, culture, and nature.</b> -->
             <!-- and offering a concentrated 
            version of the perrenial wisdom echoing across cultures throughout the history 
            of life: that you are the eternal conscious mind of the Universe, 
            one without other, one with all manifestation, and this human memory story person 
            arising within you is in fact only a view through the very set of lenses in question. -->

        <!-- <h3>A New Wave is Rising</h3> 
        <p>The current era is seeing the emergence of <b>Second Tier (Teal and Turquoise)  
            Integral Levels</b> of human development which 
            focus on holistic inclusion, developmental health, and organized meta-perspectives. 
        </p> -->
        <!-- <h3>üòï Lol whu?</h3>
        <p>Integral thinkers view life and reality in terms of the mutual 
            evolution and inter-relatedness of memetic paradigms, or living systems of ideas. 
            Civilization, nature, and the mind
            are co-emergent and overlapping systems,  
            ultimately displaying equivalent primary Level patterns of increasing complexity and self-comprehension
            - which is attractive.</p>
        <h3>üòµ‚Äçüí´ Lol... whu?</h3>
        <p>What is unique about Second Tier is that we authentically 
            embrace, include, and value all Levels, nurturing healthy 
            development for all, and hopefully assist in some way with the  
            irreconcilable apocalyptic conflicts of First Tier. </p> -->
        <!-- <h3>Characterizing Second Tier: intuitive, compassionate, encouraging, peacemaker, open-minded, 
            chameleonic (universal-doner personality), centauric (self conceptualized as story-telling meat vehicle pilot), 
            actively engaged, genuine, vulnerable, fearless, healthy, diminishing of identity and groupings,
            positive and affirmative, multi-faceted, terse and efficient, oriented to opportunities,
            networks, and abundance, spiritual, body-aware, philosophical, focused on systemic outcomes, supportive, 
            self-regulated and motivated, highly independent. </h3> -->
        <!-- <p>Right now in every moment you are consciousness. Of reality. They include one another. One and the same. It's not to reduce one to another, but to appreciate that reality has an internal and external dimension.</p> -->
