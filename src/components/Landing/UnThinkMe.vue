            you grew up with, so let's grow up together. Let's be fearlessly awake, truly being

            talk honestly about our lives, and explore some very strange territories within the realm 
            of the supposedly ordinary and mundane. 
            Let's normalize unmistakable loving kindness, compassion, and respect for the dignity
            of all sentient beings. <b>Let's not hold anything back this time.</b>
