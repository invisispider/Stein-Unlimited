## 🧠 Why I Built This

Always seeking to kill two birds with one stone - this project is my developer sandbox, my multimedia portfolio, my general perspective on things, my alternative toolset... and it's one of the ways I've taught myself to code. Working on artistic stuff keeps it fresh.

This site isn’t just a portfolio — it’s a living full-stack app that helped me:

- Learn advanced Vue 3 patterns
- Deepen my understanding of Firebase services and serverless architecture
- Implement real-world CI/CD pipelines
- Apply TDD and testing best practices with Playwright and Vitest
- Build a scalable design system with custom theming
- Real-life feedback and realtime production troubleshooting
