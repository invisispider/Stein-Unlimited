        <h3>A decreasingly imaginary business entity.</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Path of Sales: </b>The art of tricking people into giving away a favorable value is what we 
            call Old Sales, or Orange Altitude Level. We compete for what we 
            already have, maximize infrastructure to empower sociopaths and 
            leverage unfairness, and spend our time in patterns of transaction, rationalization,
            consumption, and tolerance, resulting in contemporary civilization
            and its comorbid pathologies. A true Level-up to the Sales game 
            must include transcendence of the commercial context itself.

            Creativity can transmute demoralizing experiences into meaning, value, and love. 
            Over decades of experimentation, we studied, innovated, and refined this process 
            down to three ingredients:

        <!-- <h3>Core Values</h3> -->
        <h4>Integrity - Not holding back on your good, true, and beautiful</h4>

        <!-- <h2>Our Story:</h2>
        <p>A long, long time ago, a decreasingly imaginary Turquoise corporate entity was born, as
            a lost and discouraged young man finally looked the universe in the eyes and asked some serious questions.
            In his imagination, Stein came and spoke in a language as intimate and universal as it was inscrutible.
        </p>
        <em><p>You are not You by accident. Not a coincidence.  
            Your participation drives the business. You're the one
            that must be trusted to be a moral agent. You were there, you saw the whole thing.
            You can listen to others and imitate others, and they have compelling reasons for what they think, feel, and do.
            When you're most receptive, you see that every moment is the opportunity.
            You're forced to make judgments and sacrifices. You're in a game created by logic. Matter attracting matter. Falling.
        </p>
        <p>And the whole thing about You, the thing that makes You the most special You in the whole cosmos... 
            Is that You have, inevitably, 100% total creative control over how this thing goes down.
            You can learn how Your body and mind and the world work, how to stay awake with an open heart,
            how to recognize the continuous joy of embracing Your ultimate and final responsibility for this experience.
            You can give Yourself over to that, stake Your damn livelihood on it. This is Your life. Your world.
            You choose the heroes and villians. You decide whether to believe in something, or to ask questions and progress the story.
            You're a perfect example of a human being. I'm giving You permission. I believe in You.
        </p>
        <p>You are welcomed, encouraged, and invited. We want to see You learn to sing and 
            dance and participate, to be the ideal ~Head of Sales~. I was there. I saw the whole thing. And I love You.
            You deserve this. Help people and fix things. This is the business. ~disConnectors!~
        </p></em>
        <p>And so the young man sat beneath a tree and listed out on paper all the things that composed the story of his life.
            The things that made him who he was. The treasures of his heart. The entire past and all
            his plans for the future. He shredded up the many pages and threw them into 
            the river for somebody else to clean up.
            And he arose, nothing and no one. Naked, many many years in the Future, without fear.
            The story over. His heart "broken."
            Shredded up. In the river. <b>He was ridiculous.</b> He swore an 
            oath that he would face everything and never stop being ridiculous. 
            He defined a brand. 
            --><!-- And he said, "Being ridiculous is not a game to me, friends.It's who I am and what I do." -->
