## CHAPTER ONE

---

Anthony Parsons had lived among the mountains South of the Complex as the frost in the ground continued to melt and the even surfaces were disrupted. The lands were greatly agitated, and then all had smoothed over with plants that grew in, as if from nowhere, gushing with creeks and streams now.

He had abandoned much of his gear. In only months, the hills were now littered with juvenile tree growth, and then bugs and rodents and birds had arisen. The land had become pleasant, and the air was fragrant with life.

Parsons had no visitors, and no sign of any. It was still dark much of the day. For months, he had lived this extreme military lifestyle, relishing every drink of water, every chance to relieve himself. Much of the time, the press of visions was strong, and to split wood or construct lodging was a welcome release, punctuated with spasms wherein his body rolled and writhed on the ground in agony and his mind was tortured.

After recovering, when there was no relapse, and after securing his survival needs, he would faithfully pull the recorder and notebooks from his pack and he would produce the new materials in the typical way. As he completed each etching, each stream of consciousness, each list of points, he would simply pursue the sense of urgency and familiarity.

The familiarity vanished fast, and if he were to look back at his materials, he would feel little more than an odd sense of deja vu. His dreams were a Gift. The power to dream. And to wake up moments later from distant memories. It was not helpful to try and interpret his materials himself. He was often unable to keep up with the production.

By the time the visions slowed, and then stopped, he was able to hunt and trap small game. Each day, he performed his physical routine out on the ground in long underwear. There was the steady sound of birds in the air.

His sense of emotional warmth had returned, his love of the world and life, like an old friend. Parsons felt a great sense of relief. He was only a messenger now. What he would bring to the Complex, his materials, had struck him in those cold and dark months like a final judgment. He would deliver it to them faithfully, and it would strike all of them.

Already, the moments of his life were truly behind him, like never before, and he thought that probably nobody would be more glad to meet their end in this way. He had been blessed with the most extraordinary life, extraordinarily painful and joyful and full and complete. This whole mental world, the story of a person, flapping like so many pages in the wind, and leaving nothing but the background music of the world. The many sensations. The many creatures. The system finds equilibrium.

His travel was slow, and he spent many hours each morning in meditation. Zigzagging through the enormous crags where lands had sagged, he traversed a high point on one of the final mountains for a better view of the grounds in the valley. And then there it was. The Revelation Complex. It stood defiantly and perfectly integrated with the environment, as if the world itself had turned to serve this alien colony.

He’d been told that the grounds were now peopled, and he could see the evident signs of their scattered settlements. He would have to get as close to them as possible.

The structure itself had changed considerably since Parsons had last seen it. As always, the aesthetics, the architecture, the materials, the crafts, and the presence represented by this gigantic striking oddity all came to bear on him as though he were looking into the eyes of the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, and it was clear she felt the same way. It was death. It was the death of death itself. Forever empty, forever silent. What a privilege, what a grand and glorious gift, to be consumed by the greatest dragon, the great god.

As Parsons had this thought, he became aware of a vehicle silently approaching from a distant path below. It startled him. He had assumed that it would be longer before they spotted him and dispatched this crew. It had happened faster than he could imagine.

The vehicle stopped at a point before the tree line of the young forest, and Parsons made his gentle way down from his vantage point, dropping his pack and carrying only the small case with his recorded materials inside. This marvelous vehicle was extremely quiet, and seemed to be powered by electricity. Its enormous tires were covered with a tread that seemed like the foot of an animal, so that it barely disturbed the ground when it moved at low speeds.

His heart leapt, finally, as he had not seen another person in so long. The face of a human being was a gift he was truly grateful to receive. There was no reason for him to talk to them, and they were not allowed to talk to him about anything substantial. Nevertheless, he greeted them, and they spoke some deliberately calm sounding words in their peculiar language. Again, that odd sense that he knew their words, even as he tried to work out what they likely had said to him. As with everything else, there would be no time to consider whether their language was beautiful or not, as he climbed into the passenger area of the vehicle and he now had people to read.

Two men, black uniforms with green accents, miniature computers attached to their waists. They seemed mentally stressed at first, but as the vehicle moved away from the wilderness and entered the open valley and the Complex grounds, this feeling subsided. Their speech was precise and minimal, and at times they would press on their ear and speak to someone remote. Their movements and speech were extremely optimized, with long periods of intense stillness followed by rapid communication and smooth manipulation of the vehicle controls.

As they rolled now along a path, and increasingly populated with diverse plants and animals, Parsons had the odd sense of childlike fun, to ride in the car with these strange people, to see the little huts and activities of the natives. Despite their controlled personalities, Parsons could detect their curiosity as well, and an almost inhuman warmth between these two, who were called, “people from upstairs,” in their language.

Parsons was brought inside, and sure enough, he met once again with their leader. They spoke for many hours. The materials were given over. The two embraced.

After some resting, another pair of attractive people in black uniforms came and brought Parsons down the central stairway. He was changed into a uniform, a baggy purple thing that felt like pajamas. At this point, the uncanny feeling was overwhelming, that he now breathed the air of a distant dream. One distant dream for another, and another. Rebirth in another, and then another. Waves, waves, ocean waves. The visions would return soon. But not for Parsons. He was only a messenger.

His escorts left him in a group of others like him. He greeted them warmly. They discussed their several-hour journey from the North using vehicles. Whenever he spoke, they were quiet, so he spoke for a while about the things he’d understood about his visions in the hills. They asked why he was telling them this.

“At some point,” he told them, “all words will be heard. They will be dissected. What should they do with my interpretation? They should ignore it. Allow me to be the one to try and explain myself.”

They chuckled, as if he had told a joke they did not understand, and then he had gone silent, and after a while their chatter began to pick up again. Finally, they said a prayer together, that they would be successful. Parsons leaned over the circular guard-rail and took one final look up the spectacular double-helix shaped stairway running the entire way up and down through the Complex. They shaped it like DNA, ascending. He felt a sort of motherly pride. Beavers make dams, and people build a temple to life.

Like looking up the spine of the great mother nature, or an interstellar monster’s carcass decorated with purple and red lights, smoothly articulated platform steps endless in both directions, connected in the middle by traversing walkways. And down them came a final set of two in black uniforms.

Parsons grinned as they introduced themselves, and he spoke many words before they began using their computer devices to translate English. By this time, he had run out of things to say, and the thin man, Gabriel, reminded him in a strange accent, with a strange voice, that there was no reason for any of them to say anything to one another.

He then looked askance at this, and Parsons nodded yes.

There was an extremely long moment where Gabriel continued to stare at Parsons, as though puzzled, and after a while, Parsons just stared back, and started nodding yes again. Finally, each of the eighteen present were given a door to enter branching out from the central ring of the stairway platform.

Finally, Parsons was brought to his door, and still Gabriel seemed stupefied, staring at him as though trying to recognize him. They both started to laugh, and this became infectious, but soon, Parsons entered his door, and the door was closed behind him.

There was practically nothing in the room besides a soft floor. He lay down on his back and stared up. There was a surge within him, like nothing he had ever felt before. It was not a vision, though he still felt mildly sick about that.

It was like an old familiar voice came into his emotions, certainly not his ears, and it said nothing. It was waiting. He smiled.

Okay, let’s rock, he said in his own mind, and there was no lag. The lights went out, and very quickly, the depths of absolute darkness snuffed out all of existence forever, leaving the eyes to see either nothing, or whatever the mind imagines.
