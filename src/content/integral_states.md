### A Galaxy Within

A state is a momentary snapshot of all information under consideration. You can have a state of public panic, a software data state, a brainwave state, an emotional state - States are a factor in All Quadrants at All Levels, but here we are mostly talking about States of consciousness. In the UL Quadrant, states include sensations, thoughts, feelings, moods, perceptions, attitudes, and personal affinities. The Integral Level recognizes colloquial, everyday states like hunger, fear, worry, and irritation. We call these **Ordinary** States. Psychology and medicine give us outstanding tools for decoding these felt and communicated State experiences. Mental and emotional States are commonly assessed and defined by doctors and psychologists. Many outstanding models and descriptions define the range and variety of Ordinary States, as well as neurotic and pathological States according to symptom Types (diagnostic criteria).

### Dilated Me

Nearly everyone in the world will observe that we are conscious of Gross reality as Ego with various Personalities, we mostly are unconscious during Theta Dreaming, and certainly unconscious in Delta Sleep. This is true of almost everyone not engaged with an effective and well-informed long term spiritual practice. That's not a diss at all. We're nearly everyone who ever lived and we don't know what reality tastes like. It's okay. 🫶🏿 True wisdom is knowing that we know nothing. But hey... can we at least listen to the people who have done the work? Is it okay to talk about this?

### Spiritual... 😦

We don't mean Magenta magic, Red cults, or Amber mythic membership. The spirit of a thing is its fundamental overall nature, not a force ghost. We name the spirit of everything God as that's the word in English. We set out to comprehend reality. What is the spirit of everything? What is the fundamental nature of consciousness, the essence of this now? Religions call that thing a name, and they have a relationship with it. You may hesitate to use names. Regardless, in this moment you either experience Spirit directly, in a transcendental State, or you don't. It is easy to think that you understand what these silly words mean. It seems easy to imitate and paraphrase, as I do. It's also easy to access transcendental States. You can't experience union while currently being an ego with personalities, reacting against all these various concepts. You're doomed. ⚰️

### Transcendental Consciousness

We are most interested in States that contribute to our mission of comprehending reality. Our comprehension passes through, is generated by, whatever State we're in. If I have never worked on this, or thought about it before, probably I am not in the most sober, open, clear-headed State possible. I probably don't even know how to define what I'm assessing. As we pursue this question, we encounter mystical writings, and meditation. It is pre-rational mythology. We leave. 🚪

### Rational Mysticism

We come back. 🚪 There is something to all of this. By controlling the attention, we can see and understand more clearly, more deeply, into the abstract and the unconscious. We can Wake Up. This will require practice, and likely guidance from someone who has already been through training. Our only advice on finding effective teaching is that you should put at least as much care into this decision as you would into marrying someone. With effort and time, practice may ultimately grant access to the full States spectrum, and you begin entering different mental configurations, experienced transpersonally as realms, or bodies. Spiritual States can feel unbelievably different from Ordinary, and reveal primary, key, inexpressible truths about reality.

### Spiritual States

Sources throughout history describe elusive States of consciousness called enlightment, peak experience, religious or mystical or spiritualized states (the content is whatever you believe in), trances, visions, prophecies, disembodiedness, communion with God, oneness with everything, channeling various projected entities, nonduality. These states are often regarded as epiphany or breakthrough, and may result in major positive changes to worldview, attitude, and behavior. The range, scope, wisdom, and influence of these sources is enormous, including medical reports and modern journalism. The causes and veracity of these State claims is unclear, and eternally debated.

### Comparative Religion

A sorely needed project of Integral is to foster understanding, communication, and interplay between the adherents of various values and beliefs. We point out the great strength of the religious traditions with States. We point out the deficiencies with Levels. Integral honors the supreme value of the esoteric visions underlying holy scriptures, and it makes no excuses for the inexcusable. We encourage the religious to examine what Level your community expresses, and to express your religion at the Level you actually are. We embrace several, including atheism. For atheists, we challenge you to examine the science of meditation, and seriously try spiritual practice.

### Great Nest of Being 🪺

Integral observes a perennial wisdom, or core content that is central to every spiritual perspective. Our map is one way to iterate it: Personality, Ego, Psyche, Consciousness. In the medieval Great Chain of nested realms of spiritual density, it is more like Matter, Body, Mind, Soul, Spirit. Various religions (in their esoteric interpretations) provide their own maps, and spell out the process, in the form of legend and myth most of the time. In the case of Therevada Buddhism, the instructions are quite straightforward and rational, like a manual. In Zen, the instructions contradict themselves and break your mind. In Judeo-Christian texts, the secret teachings are often coded in layers and layers of myth and membership. Many religions are not straightforward with their instructions because the documents were multi-purpose.

### Mystery Revealed

Our map gives the basic range of what variety of transcendent States can be experienced, regardless of whether you interpret it as ancestors or spirits or dieties or angels or manifest content of the psyche, or how we describe it here. Regardless of our Level, States are experienced by Ego as intense revelation, as epiphany, as death, as Ego reflects on its construction from Psyche from Consciousness. This is an extremely deep and difficult process that most people do not make it far in. We must also remember that it is our own resistance to what is that makes it difficult.

### Psychic States

Literally, we identify as the entire psyche in the psychic state, and we become able to intuitively "observe" ourselves, imagining ego into being. Early Psychic States are experienced as a sort of jailbreak. Prior to Psychic, you are configured with core assumptions that you are located at some point inside your body, at the center, the center is in the head, that this thing is my name, has my life story, is discrete from its environment, is moving through time, is at the center of space, is distant from distant memories, discrete from its parents, from its lovers, from the people it communicates with. Maybe you have some of those config settings, and maybe you don't.

### You Believe Me Now? 🤨

Psychic States are often considered exciting, frightening, disturbing, life changing, highly cerebral, and there is a tendency to mythologize the content of these States, appropriately enough. Since this is the first realm, or the first depth, beyond Gross, Psychic States are somewhat common. These would generally fit the bill for the stories that spiritual people tell one another about mind-blowing "religious states" and such. That's mostly Psychic. An ordinary person could expect Psychic States within months of starting a daily one hour meditation practice. Alternately, they could read books on meditation and mimmick the gist of what they read, and it would be hard to tell the difference.

### No Boundary

As we learn to focus into slower, deeper, wider brainwaves, in meditation and ordinary life, we start to get in touch with the invisible Psyche. We begin to comprehend how we construct reality, this very reality, from archetypes, or extremely basic memetic associations. The Psyche exposes how Ego is imagining itself into being. This is disruptive, sometimes traumatic. Psychic mystics may struggle as the solidity of their boundaries dissolve, and they may need to isolate. The Nature Mystic is a classic example and archetype.

### Subject/Object Duality

My sense of being in here with an objective world out there is an idea that I learned, so long ago that it precedes my language and thinking. If I look very carefully, and abandon my assumptions, I see that it's just this one thing. Reality is nondual. There's not two things, or four things. Just this.

### Light and Cave Thing 🌄

We experience only a portion of State reality: Ordinary, Waking, Gross, with all of its variety and diversity, all of its value. That is all we know, and we can't imagine the value of other State realms. It might have something to do with the feeling of unresolve, abandonment, antagonism, loneliness, emptiness, meaninglessness, that all mature people know. Dim cave, no idea what's out there. I can describe it all day, but let's go out there, or we'll never comprehend.

### Ego Dilemma

Face facts. We don't get it. I don't know who I am, or what I should do. I'm futile, mortal Ego. I'm doomed to lose everything, suffer, be betrayed, die. I don't deserve anything I have. Tick tick tick. Going to hell someday. Oh, it burns now. Those Noble Truths. You Wake Up and everything is gone. Everything that mattered. So you thought. But someone tugged on your arm. You shook yourself. Something woke you up. Who did you think it was? If it was a snake, it would have bit you. If you haven't been bitten, you will be. The bell tolls.

### Is This The End?

Not at all. Simply relating some Noble Truths. The Light. The Way. Good News. There is a path beyond ego to States of consciousness which enormously relieve the concerns of Ego, simply by being more aware of reality. There are many ways to arrive at States. We recommend meditation, as this is the purpose of it, and it's effective. As you experience States, it becomes easier to relate to discussions of Psychic, Subtle, Causal, and Nondual, and you no longer need Integral Theory.

### Why Enlightenment?

Enlightenment does not cure sorrow, pain, or death. It hurts more. You like it more. Imagine fearlessness. Already dead, never born. No problems. Not temporarily, this is You. Freedom and fullness. It's all made up. This is a love that touches you, hurts bad for a long time, takes away everything, makes you live forever devoted, and see that it was always your choice. Inspiration and growth, Eros, and her Shadow, death and fear, Thanatos. Reflected Integral dieties, 🧬ascending and 💔descending, beckoning you to recognize the path, follow the map, reach the conclusion. They lived happily ever after. It is perfectly acceptable, ordinary, moral, and reasonable to have insufficient or no interest in the path. Just don't pretend there isn't a path. We're already here.

### 🧘🏿🧘🏽‍♀️🧘🏼🧘🏻🧘🏿‍♂️🧘🧘🏼🧘🏿‍♂️

Meanwhile, I dare suggest we spend twenty minutes a day sitting and paying attention to Being, reducing stress, relaxing body and emotions, affirming ourselves, tuning in, practicing being more awake and aware all the time, increasing our intelligence and lifespan. Integral's primary goal is not to teach spiritual practice, but first to suggest a map of the territory under discussion. This is the frustrating ultimate fact of the matter with Integral Theory. Thinking doesn't enlighten you. It illuminates the path. It points 👉🏿🌙. For all of those who feel disappointed, don't forget to shut off that light when you leave. 🙏🏿 Namaste.
