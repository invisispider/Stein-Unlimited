            <h1>Better Time Keeping</h1>
            <p>The fastest way to introduce the unLimited clock and calendar 
                framework is to expose the problems baked into the system we use now. 
                Our update keeps what works, and addresses all deficits.
                The result is simpler to learn, easier to work with, and better suited 
                for geometry and math. Once you see the problems, the solutions are obvious.</p>
            <!-- <p> -->
                <!-- <b style="font-size: xx-large;">unLimited Time</b><br> -->
                
                <!-- A lightweight clock and calendar framework
                designed to improve time awareness.
                Once you see it, there's no turning back.</p> -->
            <!-- <h2>Deconstructing Roman/Gregorian Time:</h2> -->
            <h2>üïî What's wrong with my clock? üò¶</h2>
            <p>
            <b>Hours</b> divide Earth's daily spin into 24 hours. 
            Each has 60 <b>minutes</b>, each with 60 <b>seconds</b>. 
            Base-24 and base-60 wrap nicely around a circle and divide cleanly, 
            but they make life harder for creatures who count on ten fingers and 
            think in base-10.
            </p>
            <h3>Days aren't round?</h3>
            <p> 
                Early sundials traced the progress of a pole's shadow as the sun crossed
                the sky, resulting in circular depictions of the light half of a day. 
                You might assume your clock's hour hand mirrors Earth's rotation,
                but it actually goes around twice per day, and the 12-hour circle has no meaning. 
            </p>
            <h3>A Scheduling Grid Clock</h3> 
            <p>
            Pie charts are great for certain applications, like when you need to 
            eyeball relative proportions. They are bad clocks.
            They're terrible for seeing *what happens when*. 
            When we plan our day, we use lists and symmetrical grids ‚Äî not three 
            spinning pie charts (the clock hands.)
            </p>
            <h3>Designed for Us</h3>
            <h4>10 Sessions = 1 Day</h4>
            <h4>100 Moments = 10 Whiles = 1 Session</h4>
            <p>
            In unLimited time, everything is base-10. 
            "Session," "Moment," "While," and "Instant" are names you already use. 
            We just made them official. No more hours, minutes, and seconds ‚Äî and no need to drag 
            ancient baggage with us.
            </p>
            <h4>Why AM and PM?</h4>
            <p>
            Splitting hours into AM and PM gets closer to base-10, but adds a daily reset and extra metadata.
            How many people even know what AM and PM mean? 
            Why are we still writing time in a dead language?
            </p>
            <h2>üìÜ What's wrong with my calendar? ‚òπÔ∏è</h2>
            <p>
            Most of us don't want to work exactly five out of every seven days ‚Äî and our preference changes week to week.
            If everyone hates Monday, just get rid of it. 
            In unLimited time, a Cycle is five days. Five fingers on a hand.
            </p>
            <p>
            Months have weird names and unpredictable lengths. 
            They don‚Äôt really track anything.
            In unLimited time, <b>Habits</b> are always 45 days long, and they divide the seasons cleanly.
            </p>
            <p>
            Holidays are clumped oddly and show up at confusing times. 
            They‚Äôre often culturally exclusive, too. 
            In unLimited time, every Habit begins with a simple, secular <b>Holiday</b> named after the Habit itself. 
            Customize from there.
            </p>
            <p>
            Ancient history is hard to visualize ‚Äî you have to count backward across BC/AD.
            unLimited time starts 12,000 years ago, when timekeeping actually started to matter, not 2,000 years ago when Christians made it official.
            </p>
            <h3>Wait ‚Äî the start of the year isn‚Äôt aligned to anything?</h3>
            <p>
            Not really. It's close to the solstice... but off by a few days. 
            We fix that.
            In unLimited time, the year starts *on* the solstice and splits cleanly into four seasons.
            Adding the five-day <b>newZen Cycle</b> means Roman and unLimited calendars only mismatch by about three days (depending on leap years).

                The math is easy to do in your head once you get it. 
                For year, the last four digits are the same in both systems, so in common speech,
                it is unchanged. We secretly subtract 12000 years (the dawn of time-keeping)
                instead of 2000 (Christ and Roman Empire).

            <h1>The Year</h1>
            <p>newZen is a five or six day Holiday Cycle centering on Winter Solstice. This period seperates 
                two years, and is considered outside of time. 
                The remaining 360 days are evenly divided into 8 45-day Habits, named for the generic Holiday 
                on the first of the Habit, always Sun day. Each Habit contains 9 5-day Cycles, which are basically "weeks" without 
                Monday or Wednesday. "Day" at the end of the day name is optional.
            </p>
            <h3>A seasonal calendar</h3>
            <p>
                Solstice is the maximum intensity point of seasonal change, marking the halfway points 
                    of the year. Equinox is the center intensity point of seasonal transition, and defines quarters 
                    of the year. 
                Habits divide seasons in half.
            </p>
            <h3>Ditching months üåí</h3>
            <p> 
            A Habit is roughly a month and a half. Months are archaically tied to moon cycles. 
            While it would be nice 
            to track those, they are basically incompatible with our solar year.
            You have to ignore years if you want to track the moon. Not worth it. At base, months are
            complicated, inconsistent, and pointless.
            </p>
            <h3>1 year = 360 days + newZen</h3>
            <p>
                Here's a really cool thing about 360: 
                It divides cleanly by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9, allowing us to apply
                geometry and angle logic to the year more than we ever have before, which makes sense,
                since years actually are cyclical. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Notice which number got left out?</b> Which does
                not divide evenly by 360 degrees of a circle <em>or</em> 365 days of a year... <b>The answer is 7.</b> 
                The number of days in a week is actually the worst reasonable choice possible,
                based on ancient religious mythology.
            </p>
            <h3>Cycle math</h3>
            <p>
                Both 360 and 365 divide into 5-day Cycles. 
                Thus, there are 72 Cycles (73 with newZen) in a year.
                By declaring a five day "timeless" newZen festival at the start/end of the year, as the ancient 
                Egyptians did, unLimited Time allows us to depict a year as a circle with a + and an X 
                in the middle. Seasons and Habits. The calendar wraps around a wheel where
                each day (not counting newZen), is one degree of rotation -  
                not a new idea but perhaps exotic for those unaccustomed.

            These are the solstices and equinoxes.
            Divide in half once more, and the 45-degree turns of the year create Habits.

            <h2>unLimited Era: Earth As People</h2>
            <p>
                We aim to conceptualize human civilization, the simultaneity and inter-relatedness
                of remote places and events, and the accelerating nature of development.
                Ancient Western thinkers suffered distortions of placing themselves at the center. 
                They declared the start of history at the birth of their religion, 
                thousands of years after the pyramids of Africa and great empires of Asia. 
            </p>
            <h3>The haze of Western bias üé¥</h3>
            <p>
                Ancient times (BC) are difficult to conceptualize, because you have to 
                both add and subtract. We might refer to an event in 1976 BC as "4000 years ago (as of 2024)",
                but this remains problematic because our frame of reference is ever-changing. If you 
                read this years later, you have to do more math. Imagine now that you 
                are writing about what I'm writing, and somebody is reading what you've written ten years later. 
                The problem multiplies.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Solution: </b> the event took place 8024 years into history, 4000 years later is now
                    12,024 as I write this, and years never decrease forward through time. <b>No matter 
                    when you read this, it's true.</b> No calculation.
            </p>
            <h3>A calendar measures history</h3>
            <p>
                We estimate the historical beginings of civilization
                somewhere between 10 and 80+ thousand years ago (depending on what qualifies,) so we can start time anywhere
                in that fuzzy region, and describe every year since then as a positive 
                number. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We maintain the significance of the BC/AD 
                change by placing that point at the year 10,000 instead of 0. Nothing in history 
                happened before the unLimited era. Before year zero, 
                there is no significant human culture, so no events. The following ten thousand years is considered 
                ancient history. At 10,000, a global culture began to emerge with 
                the spread of religions (and centralized time-keeping). At 12,024 years into history, unLimited Time was launched.
            </p>
            <h3>Full compatibility</h3>
            <p>
                In common speech, we only use a year's last two digits 
                anyway. Not only these, but the entire four-digit number, remains 
                unchanged. When talking history, the full five-digit number 
                actually means something: <b>years into history.</b>
            </p> 
            <h3>Does it matter before that?</h3>
            <p>
                It really isn't 
                meaningful to talk particular years twenty-five million years ago. 
                One particular year in prehistory is indistinguishable from the next.
                People are the only timekeepers, so time tracks the age of people. 
                Just like with temperature, only particular scientists would need to consider
                the current year to be approaching 14 billion.

        <h2>Sessions</h2>
            <p>A <b>Session</b> is about how long an activity reasonably takes (about 2.2 hours), and is
            an amount of time that creates a noticable change in daylight.
            We sleep through about three of them.
            Sessions divide the day in ten, with one ~zen~ Session that resets the day
            before most people are awake (5am). 
            </p>
            <p>
            Sessions center around typical sleep and dietary habits, and often 
            coincide with a full activity, a work period, an occasion,
            weather pattern, group interaction, or location. Session names
            indicate what a typical person does around that time,
            mirroring common expressions.
            </p>
            <h3>Sessions are intuitive.</h3>
            <p>Unlike with hours, we generally use
            the name (eg. "Dawn") rather than the number. Resultantly, people will not even notice
            the difference when you speak Sessions.
            </p>
            <h3>üòé It's Your time now.</h3>
            <p>While we present what people generally do in a day as a clock,
            the point is not to prescribe a particular lifestyle or belief. 
            This framework aims to encourage health and development, but is otherwise
            unopinionated.</p>
            <h2>~zen~</h2>
            <p>zenSession is time for timelessness. Most perspectives acknowledge
            or recognize perhaps a time-transcendent quality to reality. 
            It was a creative 
            indulgence, perhaps, to take this least-desirable span and declare it in the name
            of deconstructing time itself. 
            An ideal
            time to meditate, pray, affirm, catch a fish, work on your short game üèåüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, 
            silly time, micro dance party, contemplation, lovemaking,
            watch the sun rise, do anything you want. It's a Room of Requirements - anything
            you can't make time for. Most people just sleep through it. üòú Our little secret. 
            </p>
            <!-- <h3>Timeless Time</h3>
            <p>
                A miniature Holiday before the sunrise,
                where we lovingly place the Instants, Moments, and Whiles that don't conform 
                to a base-10 grid. Use zenSession to awaken your senses, enliven your soul, renew, let go, 
                make prophecy, plans, and judgments. 
            </p> -->
            <!-- <h3>Daily commitement</h3>
            <p>People fall out of important routines such as meditation because there's never
                enough time. We've literally made time for it.  
                One justification: if you get more than 5 hours of sleep, an 
                additional hour of meditation might be more beneficial than an 
                extra hour of sleep. Many have reported feeling more rested, better health outcomes,
                and overall improved personal energy and outlook.
            </p> -->
            <h3>What's the punch line?</h3>
            <p>
                There's 80 Instants in a Moment and 80 Moments in a 
                zenSession. Quantifying the practice is discouraged. ü§£
            </p>

            <h1 id="moments">Moments and Whiles</h1>
            <h2>Units of situational awareness</h2>
            <h3>Whiles</h3>
            <p> People often remember things 
                in terms of 10-15 minute periods, "a while". We simply made that official.
                Being one minute early or late for something makes no real difference. A While
                is where it actually starts to matter.
            </p>
            <h3>Moments</h3>
            <p> 
                If you ask someone to describe what happened in a While, they
                will describe a progression of "moments". In practice, these Moments are
                slightly longer than minutes, which is why there are 80 Instants in a Moment,
                rather than 60.
            </p>      
            <!-- <h3>1 Session = 10 Whiles = 100 Moments</h3>
            <p>
                A Moment is like a sentence, and a While is like a paragraph. When you tell a story, 
                you describe a situation (chapters/Sessions), in which a progression of events (paragraphs/Whiles)
                take place with particular actions and details (sentences/Moments). In the same analogy,
                Instants are like individual words, which are mostly lost in service of a larger context.
                Just as speed-readers largely intuit or skim individual words, people do not generally 
                remember or even track particular Instants.
            </p> -->
            <h3>Intuitive Language Units</h3>
            <p>
                The best way to test this system is to say things like, "I had a session yesterday.
                It took me a while to get there. Give me a moment, please," and ask yourself
                whether you meant roughly what unLimited Time indicates.

        <h2>1 Instant = 1 second</h2>
        <p>unLimited Time runs seamlessly with existing systems, software, 
        and hardware, based around seconds and milliseconds. The goal was to improve
        timekeeping with maximum compatibility and interoperability. Technically,
        this is a framework, not its own system.

        <p>In accepting seconds, we must accept a kink in the base-10 somewhere. 
        If you think about it a lot, we don't need to conceptualize and do mental math 
        with momentary incidents as much as with medium and long term scheduling, so we accept
        the trade-off of a number base matching our number of fingers not including thumbs. ‚úãüèøü§öüèø</p>
        <!-- <h3></h3> -->
        <p>
            We don't generally think in terms of Instants. They are more for quantitative measurement
            that is generally performed by machines anyway.

            <h2>1 Habit = 45 days</h2>
            <h3>Habit: the time it takes to change</h3>
            <p>
                Aside from being half a season, it takes roughly 45 days to develop an enduring ability,
                lifestyle or social habit, and so this seemed a logical way to divide time. We encourage using the Holiday to, among other things,
                take a high-level assessment of one's own reality, and select one thing to 
                seriously commit to over the course of the Habit. We call this a Judgment.
            </p>
            <h3>1 Year = 8 Habits + 5 days (newZen)</h3>
            <p>A Habit is half of an Earth season. Each begins and ends at season changes and mid-points. Their names come from the Holiday
            which occurs on the first day. These are generic "mono-myth" Holidays, 
            which can be replaced with any existing observances occuring nearby. 
        </p>

        <h2>Cycle: the flexible work schedule</h2>
        <p>A Cycle is a five-day "week" excluding Monday and Sunday. Drop "day"
            from the day name to distinguish the two systems, which of course don't line up.
        </p>
        <h3>Sun Tues Thurs Fri Satur</h3>
        <p>Cycles, like weeks, set the work schedule. You'll notice you still have two 
            "weekend" days, but only three work days. Hmm. The cards are stacked in your
            favor. Instead of working 71% of days, you work 60%. 
        </p>
        <h3>I can do that?</h3>
        <p>
            Consider all the vacation 
            days people get, PTO, sick days, playing hookey, and of course, burn out
            and resignation, unemployment. Why? Our default work schedule is overly 
            ambitious. Let's have an option that isn't the temp or part time insult, but also
            isn't the entirety of one's life - an option for today's work force. Here is the 
            flexibility employers and employees crave. Instead of breaking 
            dumb rules, make good ones. 
        </p>
        <h3>So this is for lazy bums?</h3>
        <p>
            It's for everyone in real life. Let's now say instead that you are an 
            ambitious person. You still have to rest on Sun, you have to take care of yourself.
            But you can work on Satur, and now you're working 80% of days.

        <h3>Think about it...</h3>
        <p>Some people sometimes clearly want to work 60%, some want to 
            work 80%, and mostly people are disgruntled <em>sometimes</em> with 70%. We often say "people aren't meant to 
            live like this," and we listened. Instead of default full-time or you're worthless,
            you work "unLimited Time," giving 10% more or less than average each Cycle as your ambitions, life, 
            health, and energy dictate. 
        </p>
        <p>Thus, you or your employer can now plan each Cycle to work slightly more or less than 
            standard full time, or match it by switching each week. <b>Ya rly.</b> Employers often have too much or too little work and 
            resort to overtime or slashing hours, so 
            there you go. Get rid of silly loopholes used to 
            subvert the miserable fake prison of the 7 day full-time work schedule, and 
            commit to a system that expresses You.

        <h1>Holidays</h1>
        <h3>Every Habit 1 Sun</h3>
        <p>The first of every Habit is a Holiday Sun sharing the name of the Habit. 
            These are derived from secular themes and global holidays occuring 
            around the same time. Whatever
            locale holidays exist in your culture can be subbed in. For those more 
            interested in unLimited culture, we invite you to celebrate, embody, and add your own 
            affectations or alterations to these prototypes, which can be updated as culture 
            develops. The spirit of every Habit and every Holiday is to both include  
            the diversity of traditional sentiments and distill them
            into a universal and fundamental essence, and then those are the names.

        <h3>1 Habit = 9 Cycles</h3>
        <h3>1 Year = 8 Habits (360 days) + newZen Cycle (5 days)</h3>

        <h2>newZen Cycle</h2>
        <p>
            A special 5-6 day Holiday newZen Cycle allows Habits to be symmetrical and equal 
            length every year. On leap years, the extra day is added to newZen. Use 
            this time to distance yourself from the baggage of the preceding year, as 
            well as the pressures and expectations of the future. It is a time for the 
            eternal Now, considered to exist between years. 
        </p>
        <h3>Timeless Festival</h3>
        <p>We discourage timekeeping 
        and time-based conceptions during this global Holiday fiesta.
        Many cultures treat this time as an extended holiday, while others celebrate only 
        the first of the year. 
        The Egyptian calendar chose 360 days with a festival period because 
        it seemed logical. We arrived at exactly the same solution 
        before we knew it.
        </p>

        <h3>Judgement</h3>
        <p>To get the full integrated effect of the Habit concepts, we encourage 
            a Judgment ritual on each Holiday. This is a day to act as your own coach and 
            manager, to reflect on the previous Habit, to decide where you are on your journey,
            how you feel about everyone and everything, even though you don't know for sure. You're just making 
            firm decisions about who you are, what you're doing, what you think, feel, and do, and 
            leaving all of these perceptions open to future development. This is a time to make 
            decisions about now, to check in, to let go, to move forward.
        </p>
        <h3>unLimited Culture</h3>
        <p>Our time system is intended for all people, encouraging comparative cultural synthesis and 
            integral inclusion. We use zen as a default spirituality because we 
            find it agreeable, global, open-ended, and also robust. Using unLimited Time
            does not mean you have to meditate or develop yourself, any more than an 
            American atheist using standard time has to believe in Santa Claus or Columbus.
            For average users, these could be vacation days, date nights, and road trips.
        </p>
        <h3>Holy and Divine</h3>
        <p>For the spiritual, the ~zen~ times are when we observe the personal, 
            the cultural, the secular, the intimate, the beautiful, we commune, we practice.
            Psychologically, we may do things to reset, reboot, or self-manage. Just as with 
            traditional holidays, we have distilled the collective spirit of a time of 
            season into an official calendar date. These are focus nodes.
