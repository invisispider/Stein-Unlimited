        whimsical, fantastic way. 
        Magical fantasy and the sense of things having spirits, however incorrect, 
        is entirely native, natural, and healthy to the human psyche. All functions of our person

        Legend does not offer universal notions of reality, but rather excellent examples of 
        particular principles, as in the Odyssey of Homer. Legends empower us 
        to be clever and strong and powerful and fair and sexually attractive by modeling the father, the hero, the villain, the seductress, 
        the wizard, and even the ego. We worship archetypal personalities as the highest ideals, 
        and it is believed that we can channel and invoke these ancestral dieties. The 
        epic tragedy, the tall tale, the fable, the legend, is born. Legend is concerned with the 
        superlative and miraculous, often ad absurdum. If we 
        were sticklers, we might call Red Personality-ish instead of selfish or egotist. Red is 
        the height of the Personality 
        affinity, and only the birthplace of Ego. This self is a thing that believes whatever it wants, 
        nobody tells it what to do, it only cares 
        about what relates to itself, it is helpful when it wants something. Like an angsty 
        adolescent, it mostly wants

    emergence: `As social communities grow and begin to undertake more ambitious 
        projects, militarism and personal courage become essential. Physical prowess and 
        aggression are valued, often celebrated in duels, challenges, and rites of 
        passage that serve as the basis for symbolic and psychosexual self-promotion. 
        This results in a deeply unsettling desensitization to human 
        suffering, for the equal sake of warrior, victim, and leadership. Programs of desensitization stunt 
        emotion and intellect and enable great feats of will and heartless cruelty. True 
        interpersonal power is experienced for the first time, with mass campaigns of 
        murder, slavery, and cruelty at the hands of despot clan lords or god kings. Central leadership 
        enables the building of great monuments, pyramids, fine artifacts, relics, and scrolls, 
        as well as awe-inspiring public festivals and ceremonies. Legends of 
        ancestral heroes and kings, mythic chimeras, regional dieties, or elemental gods, perhaps 
        the celestial bodies themselves, become the 
        prevailing oral tradition, and represent the earliest literary works that we can 
        access today. Legends empowered humanity to their ultimate glory, 
        and led to their prophesied world conquest. Here we are.`,
    relate: `The healthy and unhealthy aspects of Red can be seen in atheletics teams 
        and their fans, with a worshipful attitude towards the greatness 
        of one arbitrary regional team physically challenging 
        another in a winner-take-all scenario. Red is the individuation of self and other, 
        resulting in 
        immediate preference for self (or Personality.) Children at Red 
        begin to resist, defy, or even deceive or bully the parent. This rebel 
        without a cause attitude may largely dissipate through socialization, or remain 
        a subdued character trait. Petty acts of theft and vandalism, fights, antisocial stunts, sneakiness, 
        needless defiance, and perversion are common in adolescence, and serve as the legend 
        of schoolyard or neighborhood. Modern Red adults are often deemed ignorant or 
        low class, and associated with racism, sexism, and extremist beliefs. Selfish, 
        here, does not mean self-maximizing (Orange) Ego, with high self-esteem and 
        a neutral worldview. We mean narcissistic, impulsive, reactive, 
        and in our culture, self-destructive. Globally, we see that genocide, slavery, 
        trafficking, terrorism, and narcissistic legends abound as the governing principle of 
        many locales. 
        In yourself, you may understand Red as the mythos or cult of personality that exists 
        around you and your life. It may be your self-indulgent side, your petty, contrary, feisty, outrageous, ridiculous, 
        honest, or pushy side. 
        Red loves to party, and is appropriate for adult sexual expression as well. 
        It remains in our nature as we develop, and we must not be ashamed or repress 
        this Level's power god, as it will continue to inform your personal confidence and 
        sense of agency. Healthy Red expresses 
        intense personal warmth and respect, familial comfort, safety, indulgence, and personal loyalty. Red 
        is the truest expression of your unique personality prior

        elite were discovering inevitable facts and principles about the world that contradict 
        the religious hegemony of the sciences. Social movements and underground

        breaks the tide, compelling greater numbers, the people revolt and form a

        of belief and expression. Separation of church and state is mandated by law, and human 
        intellect explodes, with massive advancement in applied disciplines, thought,

        unfair competition, and litigiousness. 
        Psychology and psychiatry emerge in earnest. Inebriants relieve symptoms for now. 
        This is not a new problem. Nobody ever cared how commoners felt before. 
        Meanwhile, Orange invents 
        the landmark achievement that spells certain doom for principle-avoidant rational pragmatism - a bomb that 
        ends civilization.`,
    relate: `Orange will be relatable to most people. 
        The fundamental conceit of our culture is that a person can know reality 
        through reason, logic, and education. We are educated in schools 
        that teach science, math, history, language, and what amounts to a liberal education for  
        a national citizen. individualism is a given. 
        Rationality and objectivity have a global, 
        as opposed to regional, scope. Orange has moved 
        into the abstract and cerebral Right Quadrants, and the notion of universal governing principles (LR) 
        ought to be compatible with repeated observation (UR) by qualified individuals (UL) and these 
        will be validated by a community (LL) of competent peer review.  
        As a rational person reconciling yourself with pre-rational superstitions, consider that 
        Amber doesn't conceptually "get" the notion of the LR, 
        so "proof" doesn't exactly mean anything. The mythic believer 
        is compelled to accept only notions which feel morally correct "in the heart," which 
        circulates blood and does not feel emotions. 
        It actually requires a youth spent in a quality school to become genuinely capable of 
        comprehending nature. Amber keeps their children out of schools that 
        teach rational facts and methodologies. 
        Orange is far from the top, but it is configured, for the first 
        time, to test the truthiness of myths, and describe universal 
        patterns. The best articulation of Orange (and Orange Shadow) 
        can be found in Ayn Rand's philosophical literary fiction. Orange 
        is certain, which is tempting, but we must remember that this 
        is partial certainty, through a lens. We can, once again, deconstruct the 
        lens. The rational self, and the rational world, must open themselves to the critics,

        We get a constant treadmill of new terms for 
        hate expression concepts and group identity descriptors. Is this the dreaded "Mean" Green Meme, or 
        does the rise of everyday public criticism act more like Amber 
        membership in Green, or Orange exploitation of Green? We blame Green for protests 
        that devolve into riots due to the inclusion of Red, 
        which only happens because Green is Level-blind, nonheirarchical, and considers everyone equal 
        regardless of merit or competence. 
        Green does not like placing "labels" on people, often labeling this behavior "labeling" and 
        the perpetrators "labelers." Green places Teal in the category of "people who like to place 
        people in categories so they can think less of them," so they can think less of them. 
        Because Teal considers some perspectives deeper or wider than others, Green considers itself superior to Teal, 
        and it cannot be made to see this performative self-contradiction. 
        The pluralist will refuse to try on a lens that ranks how much 
        you are capable of caring about. 
        It will deconstruct Altitudes and seek out questionable trivia

        The need for a map of reality exposes a childish wish for 
        control and certainty, for finding purpose in something grand and special. 
        Denying the evolutionary growth heirarchy of consciousness 
        precludes Green from exerting much power, or establishing peaceable 
        global governance. Nevertheless, Green's currency is influence, and it 
        has been influential. It now faces major backlash from lower Levels.

        Turquoise is also States and Quadrants aware, though that may mean different things depending on their 
        particular personal flavor of Turquoise. Just as Teal was able to individuate Levels, Turquoise is undergoing an 
        integration of Levels with a holonic evolutionary view of the kosmos. State practices may occur at any Level for 
        various reasons, but at Turquoise, spiritual practice becomes logically inevitable. The depths of 
        Psyche beckon, and being open-minded and curious, Turquoise is familiar with transcendental literature and notions by now.`,
    emergence: `Just as Orange finds rationality and Green applies rationality to rationality to discover more 
        truly rational rationality, Teal discovers Levels, and is fascinated with them, but still Teal does not 
        grasp the full meaning and applicability of Levels. This is not merely a scale of human potential, 
        it is the structural essense of thought itself, a true map of the construction of reality. 
        While again, not everyone at these Levels has access to this chart or these concepts, Teal is 
        intuitively aware of something resembling Levels, and Turquoise is aware of the whole 
        Integral Theory, though again that might not mean Ken Wilber's version of it. Just as Orange scientists 
        can squabble and debate over particulars and ultimately be on the same page at the rational Level of consciousness, 
        anyone with a deep and applied comprehension of Levels, Quadrants, and States, could be considered Turquoise.`,

        This is a person who is extremely intellectually literate, and will seem inevitably spiritual, in a way that is not 
        at all based on their beliefs, or their claims, but seems to exude more from their words, personality, and actions. 
        This is the highest stage included in nearly any Line stage system. A random sample of people 
        might yield Second Tier Levels at a significant enough rate that Second Tier could be detected. Third Tier is so 
        rare that even if people at these Levels did show up in a sample, they would stand out as extreme outliers and would 
        go into the slush pile with people who scribbled all over the assessment, tore it up, or put the same answer for every 
        question. Turquoise won't show up in random samples. You have to look for it. For Third Tier, you have to really 
        be motivated. You can do it. Namaste.`,

    values: `Psychic refers to direct personal awareness of the psyche. A psychic State of consciousness can be achieved 
        somewhat readily, though it will not be recognized at such unless it is quite deep or profound. This realm of States 
        tends to measure low Alpha and Theta brainwaves, suggesting a somewhat dreamlike waking experience, and is often 
        described in terms of a dissolution of boundaries and identities, a sense of waking up to oneness with the environment, the body, 
        the world, a diety. This can lend a sense of subtle radiation or aura, an extreme sense of novelty in the mundane, 
        a childlike sense of profound wonder and vulnerability. These states can be accessed within months of daily meditative 
        practice for most people, or can occur spontaneously, through intellection and will, and through communication. 
        If a person is generally coming from the Second Tier, and they learn to regularly access this state, so that their Psyche 
        is now actively communicating with Ego in daily life, and Ego keeps coming back, this is entry-Level 
        transcendental mysticism.`,

    emergence: `There is no major social or technological movement for any of the Third Tier Levels, though this may 
        be debated. Psychic States of consciousness are described in some of the earliest writings we know of, and it seems 
        safe to assume that Psychic States have always been relatively commonplace. Legitimate Psychic State-specific 
        practices remain active mainly in the context of indiginous spiritualities, as well as in alternative, new age, and 
        occult interests and therapies. Psychic States appear to have played a major role in the formation and administration 
        of Magenta and Red Meme Civilizations, often guided or led by priests, priest-kings, god-kings, sorcerors, shamans, 
        prophets, oracles, and seers, who often underwent intensive State practice training, including rites of passage, vision 
        quests, trials, and snake taming. At any rate, we are suggesting that the path forward from Turquoise naturally leads 
        to this plasmoid State of the mind, the psychic bands, where our most primitive assumptions are dissolved and understood 
        to be illusory. Though people have historically learned to hack this State, it occurs naturally and properly, for everyone, 
        as the Level after Turquoise.`,

        Direct control of the brain, typically slowing it down or practicing meditation, is an aspect of the lifestyle, and the 
        lifestyle will reflect a sincere and earnest dedication to maintaining connection to the spiritual. Intuitive forces and 
        visions may lead one to pursue strange activities, perhaps spontaneous poses or dances, creating drawings or words that 
        seem important though it isn't clear yet why. Always chasing the question mark, Indigo is the seeker.

        This affinity is classically often depicted as a relationship between self and deity, or the spirit of the universe, or God.

        description, this might sound unremarkable to an Ego that has never experienced Consciousness as Consciousness. For the

        mode of perception of various historic prophets and messiahs and gurus. It can also be argued that 
        only Eastern practices, particularly Buddhism and yoga, clearly describe a distinct nondual State and provide instruction for accessing it.`,

        what we call history, the human being and Earth are barely recognizable, and Integral Theory is unnecessary. 
        If you are wondering how to tell the difference between the nondual and causal State, that is more or less a matter of specialization. 
        As I understand, nondual is an integration of causal, subtle, and gross realms, so that the enlightened State is 
        experienced not only within the practice, but within all activities, all the time. We never said we were right - this is just 
        our best attempt to describe higher realities beyond our own insight. We should certainly expect new Levels to emerge beyond the visible 
        spectrum, the analogical gamma and x-rays. This means we have fundamentally transcended humanity, people, and history, we have 
        become something new and unfathomable, and the Levels past 
        Clearlight entering deep UV wavelengths should be just as transformative as the onset of Life on Earth and the divergence 
        of social people from animals.
