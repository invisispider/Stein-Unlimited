            Redesigning the clock and calendar we use every day to make 
            time simple, easy, predictable, elegant, inclusive, and  
            maximized for the concerns of our era.

        <h4>
        Eliminate the days we don't like from the work week.<br>
        Unit names are derived from ways we naturally describe and conceptualize time.<br>
        Holidays and period changes align predictably with consistent natural events.<br>
        Base-10 units designed for easy comprehension and arithmetic.<br>
        Cultural bias leans away from Greek and Roman sources, embracing global and postmodern values.<br>
        Open-source and fully compatible with standard system clocks and calendars.
        </h4> -->
        <!-- <p>How about simply counting in your head how many days since any other day?</p> -->
